            <h1>HISTORY OF MYNTRA</h1>
            <p>
              Becoming India’s no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy feat.
              Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a team of dedicated
              personnel with an equally loyal customer base have made Myntra the
              online platform that it is today. The original B2B venture for
              personalized gifts was conceived in 2007 but transitioned into a
              full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of just a few years. By
              2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian and international brands to
              its platform, and this has only grown in number each passing year.
              Today Myntra sits on top of the online fashion game with an
              astounding social media following, a loyalty program dedicated to
              its customers, and tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals. The Myntra
              shopping app came into existence in the year 2015 to further
              encourage customers’ shopping sprees. Download the app on your
              Android or IOS device this very minute to experience fashion like
              never before

            <p>
              Another reason why Myntra is the best of all online stores is the

              user-friendly interface will guide you through your selection

              You also have the freedom to choose your payment options, be it
              card or cash-on-delivery. The 30-day returns policy gives you more
              power as a buyer. Additionally, the try-and-buy option for select
              products takes customer-friendliness to the next level. Enjoy the
              hassle-free experience as you shop comfortably from your home or
